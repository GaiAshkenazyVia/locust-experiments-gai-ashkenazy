As for aggregated results, Locust slaves collect atomic results and combine them to compute aggregations
 (relevant Locust code is located in [stats.py](https://github.com/locustio/locust/blob/0.10.0/locust/stats.py)
  if you are interested) and sent to the master.
You can leverage slave_report event hook to get access to the data. In our case, we have report_data_producer
 method added as the slave_report event listener:
```python
locust.events.slave_report += report_data_producer
```

The listener receives two parameters:
* client_id, which identifies the slave which sent the report
* data, an object with actual payload data

The payload (data) object has the following top level keys:Â 
```json
{
  "stats":[], "stats_total":{ }, "errors":{}, "user_count":0
}
```
